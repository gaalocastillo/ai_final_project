He seems not to understand the problem because you canÃ¢ÂÂt describe it lucidly enough. You donÃ¢ÂÂt understand the proposed treatment because he canÃ¢ÂÂt explain it. IÃ¢ÂÂve sometimes foresworn medical help because the complexity of voicing what is wrong has felt heavier than the sickness itself. This is especially true for psychiatric illnesses such as the depression I have experienced, but it is true of physical problems, too. It has been entirely manifest to me when IÃ¢ÂÂve tried to explain the problem with my left ear, in which I am partially deaf. IÃ¢ÂÂve said what it feels like, to which my consultant has repeatedly replied with various options. IÃ¢ÂÂve said it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt feel like any of the things in his multiple-choice list and theorised about what is actually wrong. He has resisted my inexpert opinions, and I have battled with his inability to grasp the subtlety of my experience.
