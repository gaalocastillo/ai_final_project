His reÃÂ­marks left two quesÃÂ­tions: What exÃÂ­actÃÂ­ly will the Fed do? And when?

In practical terms, the surest way to eat better is cooking most of your food at home or, failing that, talking some other nice person into doing it for you. The more you eat out or rely on convenience food, the more the balance of your diet will go the wrong way. The more food you eat that isnÃ¢ÂÂt homemade, the poorer your diet is likely to be in terms of nutrition and the quality and provenance of its ingredients.
